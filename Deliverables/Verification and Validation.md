## Description
Our game is a 2D sidescroller that takes place in a medieval setting. It is a competitive speedrunning game where players control a knight character and try to complete the level as fast as possible. The level design includes platforms that players must jump between, and there are also collectibles like coins and power-ups. Coins increase the player's score, while power-ups provide abilities like speed or jump boosts. When the player finishes the level, their time and score are saved and used to determine their position on the leaderboard. Our goal is to replicate the success of similar games in the past and address the issue of current games being dull and uninteresting. We created the game's art style ourselves, which is simple yet captivating. Overall, Go Forth! is an enjoyable and attractive game that appeals to a wide range of gamers, from casual to serious.

**User Review 1**: "A Nostalgic Dash Through Medieval Adventures" (4/5 stars)

Go Forth! resurrects the golden era of 2D sidescrollers, infusing a competitive spirit within a medieval world. The game's emphasis on speedrunning is a breath of fresh air, challenging players to navigate through creatively designed levels, hopping across platforms while snagging coins and leveraging power-ups along the way.

The competitive edge, highlighted by the leaderboard system, sparks the drive to constantly refine your skills and climb the ranks. The incorporation of power-ups offers strategic depth, though a wider array of these enhancements could have added more diversity to the gameplay.

The simplistic yet charming art style contributes to the game's allure, evoking a sense of nostalgia while still feeling visually appealing. However, Go Forth! might benefit from additional level variations or surprises to sustain engagement in the long term.

Despite this, the game succeeds in capturing the attention of both casual players and die-hard enthusiasts of the genre. Its blend of familiar mechanics with competitive elements makes it an enjoyable escapade through medieval realms, inviting players to relive the joy of classic sidescrolling adventures while embracing the thrill of competition.

**User Review 2**: "Medieval Speedrunning Excitement!" (4/5 stars)

Go Forth! offers a delightful twist to the sidescroller genre with its competitive speedrunning mechanics set in a medieval backdrop. The game's core concept of completing levels as swiftly as possible while collecting coins and utilizing power-ups creates an engaging gameplay loop. Mastering the art of maneuvering through the intricately designed platforms demands skill and precision, adding depth to the overall experience.

The incorporation of a leaderboard system motivates players to continually strive for better times and scores, fostering a competitive community. The variety of power-ups adds a strategic element, allowing for diverse approaches to tackle the levels, although a bit more variety in these power-ups would elevate the gameplay further.

The handcrafted art style is charming and suits the game's theme well, enhancing the overall appeal. However, while Go Forth! is undeniably enjoyable, it might benefit from additional level diversity or challenges to prevent monotony in the long run. Nonetheless, it caters well to a broad spectrum of gamers, offering a satisfying blend of nostalgia and modern competitive gaming.

**User Review 3**: "A Decent Attempt at Reviving Classic Fun" (3/5 stars)

Go Forth! brings back the essence of classic 2D sidescrollers in a medieval setting with a focus on competitive speedrunning. The game's simplicity is its charm, allowing players to dive straight into the action. Navigating through the levels while collecting coins and utilizing power-ups offers a decent level of entertainment, albeit lacking depth in terms of variety.

The competitive aspect, with its leaderboard system, adds replayability as players aim to improve their times. The art style, though simple, has a certain appeal that captures the essence of the game's theme effectively.

However, Go Forth! struggles to break away from the genre's conventions and doesn't introduce significant innovations. The repetitive nature of the gameplay and the limited diversity in level design may deter some players from sustained engagement. While enjoyable in short bursts, the game might need additional content or mechanics to maintain long-term interest among players seeking more depth and complexity in their gaming experiences.
