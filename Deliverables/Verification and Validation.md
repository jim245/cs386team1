## Description
Our project is a 2D sidescroller set in a medievel setting. The game is a competative speedrunner with players controlling a knight character, attempting to reach the end of the level as quickly as possible. The level design consists of platform the player must jump between. There are also collectibles such as coins and power-ups. Coins simply add to the player's score while power-ups give abilites to the player such as speed or jump boosts. Once the player reaches the end of the level, their time and score are saved and used to determine the user's position on the leaderboard. Our game aims to recreate the success of past games with similar mechanics, we hope to solve the issue of current games on the market being benign and boring. The art style of the game was entirely created by us and is simple yet engaging. Overall, *Go Forth!* is a fun, appealing game that attracts multiple types of gamers from casual to serious.
