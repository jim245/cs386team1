## Description
Our game is a 2D sidescroller that takes place in a medieval setting. It is a competitive speedrunning game where players control a knight character and try to complete the level as fast as possible. The level design includes platforms that players must jump between, and there are also collectibles like coins and power-ups. Coins increase the player's score, while power-ups provide abilities like speed or jump boosts. When the player finishes the level, their time and score are saved and used to determine their position on the leaderboard. Our goal is to replicate the success of similar games in the past and address the issue of current games being dull and uninteresting. We created the game's art style ourselves, which is simple yet captivating. Overall, Go Forth! is an enjoyable and attractive game that appeals to a wide range of gamers, from casual to serious.
