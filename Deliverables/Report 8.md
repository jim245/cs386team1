## 1. Summary of Activities
Colin – I added the simplest form of camera movement that can be changed later on if need-be, and a framework for the score mechanic. Later fixed player movement bug. <br>
Andrew – I worked on setting up a title screen with only one button to start the game.<br>
Zach – I worked on creating the in-game timer that will be used for the leaderboard. <br>
Jack – I built the basic level layout, adding platforms and structure to the game. I coded the platforms to allow the player to jump through from underneath. I also distributed the spike objects Jade produced throughout the level.<br>
Jade – Implemented basic spikes that kill the player and send them back to the start of the level. <br>

## 2. Project Retrospective

  2. Successes: Basic features were implemented well<br>
  3. Failures: N/A <br>
  4. Barriers: Time issues, other classes taking up large portions of our time. <br>
  5. What we should try next time: Working ahead farther, preventing a crunch between the meeting and deliverables. <br>

## 3. Next steps
Begin laying out the architecture of the whole system for future deliverables. Add some missing features, focusing on the leaderboard system.
