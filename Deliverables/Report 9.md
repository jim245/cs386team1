## 1. Summary of Activities
Colin – Fixed up timerController for better cross-script accessibility, fixed score handler, so it can finally hold an actual score, and added an end-point that pauses the time and later on will complete the level.<br>
Andrew – Created initial unit tests to test basic movement. Fixed a bug preventing the "New Game" button on the title screen from functioning properly. <br>
Zach – <br>
Jack – <br>
Jade – Started work on an initial power-up item. <br>

## 2. Project Retrospective
  1. Appreciations: Progress has really picked up recently. <br>
  2. Successes: Got a title screen working, and a functional level timer. <br>
  3. Failures: N/A <br>
  4. Barriers: Asynchronous work prevents long sessions of work between multiple people. <br>
  5. What we should try next time: Working on the next deliverable ahead of time. <br>

## 3. Next steps
Now that we have a good foundation for our project with the initial level, we will work on implementing key features such as the leaderboard and the power-up system. We also must work on the next deliverable.
