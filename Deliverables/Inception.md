Go Forth and explore this 2D world! It is a 2D sidescroller set in the medieval period. You are tasked by the king to explore a dangerous area and collect relics to bring back to the kingdom. Speedrun your way to the end of levels or take time to explore your surroundings and obtain powerups to assist you on your journey. 
This is a risk-and-reward style speedrunning 2d sidescroller! Will you perfectly execute your run to the end or opt to acquire special powers to help you later on?
