# Report 1
Group 1: The Game<br>
Date and Location: 09/09/2023 @ Cline Library, Room 292 <br>
Present Participants: Andrew, Colin, Jade and Zach <br>
Missing Participants: Jack <br>
Project repo: https://github.com/jim245/cs386team1/tree/main <br>

## 1. Summary of activities
We all developed and solidified the idea for the project, starting looking around for resources to use. <br>

## 2. Project Retrospective
The only issue we had was some initial communication via Discord and Canvas mail. Since it is the first week, there is nothing else to report. <br>

## 3. Next steps
We need to look for resources that could potentially help us develop this game, and start to learn the tools we are going to use, namely Unity. This applies to everyone for now. Colin found a youtube playlist that helps go over how to make a similar program with unity.<br>

## Project Idea
A 2d sidescrolling platformer in Unity. The character would have 8 directional movement, every 45 degrees depending on what arrow keys are pressed. Prioritizing ones pressed first. Gravity will of course be present. <br>
Optional Additons: Wall dashes (1st priority if possible), moving platforms/fading platforms, more precise movement. <br>

## Technologies
Unity + various libraries <br>
