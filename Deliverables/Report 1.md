A 2d sidescrolling platformer in Unity. The character would have 8 directional movement, every 45 degrees depending on what arrow keys are pressed. Prioritizing ones pressed first. Gravity will of course be present 
Optional Additons: Wall dashes (1st priority if possible), moving platforms/fading platforms, more precise movement
