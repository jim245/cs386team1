# Implementation 2

## Introduction
For gamers looking for a thrilling experience and serious gamers seeking a competitive edge, Go Forth! is a 2D platforming game that offers a lively gameplay experience through its distinct speedrunning leaderboard. The leaderboard and built-in timer promote a fast-paced, engaging environment that encourages competition among players. In-game, players can choose between the quickest route through the level, or the potential for a power-up that will save them time in future levels. This system allows players to pick a playstyle that works best for each individual. Go Forth! ensures that boredom and sluggish gameplay are replaced with excitement and the motivation to achieve top rankings, ultimately reinvigorating the gaming community and increasing player retention. As of now, our game contains an initial level that showcases the player's movement and the obstacles they must surpass. View our project on GitHub [here](https://github.com/jim245/cs386team1). <br>
