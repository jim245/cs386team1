## 1. Summary of activities
Each member reports on their activities since the last meeting. Remember that coding activity is expected every week. <br>

## 2. Project retrospective
In each meeting, you should spend a few minutes discussing how the group is functioning. What aspects of the group dynamics contribute to the success of the project? In addition, raise any issues—best done directly but with humor and kindness—that you believe are interfering with the effectiveness of the group and your ability to complete the project on time. <br>
The project retrospective is an opportunity for the group and each individual to reflect on their experience with the project and improve the way the group works together. Make at least five lists: <br>
  1. Appreciations: highlights of contributions from team members <br>
  2. Successes: what went well <br>
  3. Failures: what did not go well <br>
  4. Barriers: things that are blocking the maximum performance of the team <br>
  5. What we should try next time. <br>

If you don’t have anything to report in one of these lists, just state it. <br>
A common practice among software teams is to use sticky notes (one color for each category), which each team member uses to write down their ideas for each category (one idea per sticky). As people post their stickies on the whiteboard, the facilitator should group similar or duplicate ideas together. This way the idea becomes decoupled from the person who introduced it. Discuss your ideas briefly as a team. <br>
Make the retrospective an open and safe space for the team to reflect on and discuss what works well (and what doesn't!) so you can improve. Don't make it personal, and don't take it personally. Be open to criticism and offer constructive and polite critiques. Focus on how to improve the quality of your team and the product you are developing. <br>

## 3. Next steps
Think about what needs to be done and assign tasks. Update your activity tracker with new tasks, actual hours spent in the activities, corresponding GitHub issues, and the status of the work. <br>
