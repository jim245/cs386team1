## 1. Summary of activities
Colin – I am reviewing the material once over and solidifying my knowledge on Unity. Additionally, filling out the project more. <br>
Andrew – Added ability to collaborate on GitHub through my local Unity installations. Also started using Unity to figure out how things can be implemented such as our pixel art and the character. <br>
Zach – I am learning more about Unity, and also updating the activity tracker.<br>
Jack – I have been watching videos on existing games similar to our concept to get ideas on what to implement. I have also continued to learn unity. <br>
Jade – Been reviewing the basics of Unity, got the initial game files in the repo, and cloned to my local machine. Have also been outlining a basic client-server structure to use for the leaderboard. <br>

## 2. Project retrospective
  1. Appreciations: Shoutout to Jade for helping lead the project and encourage us. <br>
  2. Successes: Unity working, was really struggling on how to fix a certain issue. <br>
  3. Failures: A couple team members were not available this weekend, so the meeting did not really happen. <br>
  4. Barriers: People being sick and out of town causing communication problems. <br>
  5. What we should try next time: Talking to everyone more in class. Work on the first release. <br>

## 3. Next steps
We need to work really hard on the game to get it actually running in preparation for the first iteration deliverable and midterm presentation. Getting a functional game running, with the ability to communicate with a server is the highest priority.
