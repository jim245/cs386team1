This system allows players to pick a playstyle that works best for each individual. Go Forth! ensures that boredom and sluggish gameplay are replaced with excitement and the motivation to achieve top rankings, ultimately reinvigorating the gaming community and increasing player retention. As of now, our game contains an initial level that showcases the player's movement and the obstacles they must surpass.
